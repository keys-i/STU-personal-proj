## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

- Make a Github Issue
- Include: a clear description, reproduction steps, affected versions/commit, and any relevant logs or proof-of-concept.

Best effort only:
- I will try to acknowledge reports when I can, but response times are not guaranteed.
- Fixes may be delayed or may not be implemented.
- If I do fix the issue, I will typically patch `main` first and may not backport releases.
